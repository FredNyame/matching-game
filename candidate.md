Some of the things to be completed given more time are the following:

2. Moving the State in Vuex which will enable the below listed items execution more easier.
3. Having a inital walkthrough guide to show the rules of the game.
4. Tracking the best score across multiple games.
5. Providing a UI interface for users to set their own preference for the game.
    1. Setting their own number of pairs
    2. Having an option to choose what UI interface to use for the pairs, for example replacing the numbers with an images.
    2. Level of difficulty adjustment, for example: the time remaining countdown. or even adjusting the number of seconds the pairs stay when they are not a match.
