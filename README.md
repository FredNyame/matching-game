## Matching Game

### User Story

- A user is presented with many pairs of randomized hidden values.
- A user will be able to reveal 2 of the hidden values.
- If the values match, they remain visible. If the values do not match, they are returned to their hidden state.
- A user will be able to repeat the process of revealing 2 hidden values until all pairs of values are visible. At this point, the game is over and the user has won.
- A user should be able to see how many attempts have been made to match values.
